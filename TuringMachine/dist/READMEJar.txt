************************************** Jar file instructions *********************************

The included jar file is yet another way of running the machine. But there are a few considerations that are unique to the jar. The jar, unlike independent installers, does require that you have the following installed on your system:

    JRE Version 7+ with JavaFX 8.

Unless your installed version of java is fairly outdated, you should already meet this requirement, as JavaFX is packaged with all recent java release. If you do not meet this requirement, or do not have java installed, please see oracle’s support site for information on installing java for your chosen platform.

See a full list of java installation materials for all platforms here: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

Assuming these requirements are meet, you can run the program via jar on any desktop platform fairly easily, although be aware that this will not install the program, and so you would need to repeat this process every time to run it. If you would like install the program to your machine, please see the installers folder, and the associated README documentation for more information on installing to your platform.

Running the program from the jar file is fairly straightforward, and the command used to do so will be the same across all platforms. The majority of platforms (Ubuntu, Windows, etc.) could also support launching the .jar file by simply double clicking on it. Alternatively, you can run it via a command prompt or terminal by navigating to the folder containing the .jar and using the following command:

java -jar TuringMachine.jar
