Axosoft/Git Integration Setup and Use – OUTLINE

Preface:	Software Development & Practices… SCRUM, TOOLS, CONVENTION - why we are here.
		Coding we know by now, learn the software engineering aspect first and foremost!

1) SSH key and git remote setup:
	- ssh key generated on vm (AND on thor if not already done first!)
	- key transmitted to thor from vm
	- remote set-url commands to setup dual-push on commit
	- email address (buffs) used throughout this process!
2) Github setup:
	- FREE account allows ALL to view, only COLLABORATORS to modify
	- $7/mo account allows full privatization or full open
	- setup a REPO acct (no collab) (give meaningful username, NOT repository name)
	- setup account for each group member using same email address as git configured
	- vm ssh key applied in repo account “SSH and GPG keys” for each team member
	- member github usernames applied to github repo Settings> Collaborators
3) Axosoft integration:				ONE DOCUMENT PROVIDED FOR 1-3 COMBINED
	- TOOLS> Manage Extensions > Github
	- apply Github API key to Axosoft
4) Axosoft tagging:				ONE DOCUMENT PROVIDED FOR 4 ONL			
	- importance of proper time estimate and then time application (actual)
	- simple set of codes to learn for commits
5) Wrap it all up:				OVERHEAD PROJECTION (Click through examples)
	- SET EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS in Axo/GitHub, OR YOU WILL BE INUNDATED WITH EMAILS!!!
	- quick walk-through on how everything drops into axosoft from git/github
	- quick introduction to gitkraken for those interested

Commit path:         git    github    axosoft
			work done    view of work detail post-commit    bird’s-eye project view

Benefit:	Immediate drill down capabilities from work item in axo to code changes in repository
		KEY   Most axosoft logging can be done with the commits that are already being made
			(Reduces amount of time and keystrokes spent logging time and such by hand!)

Other:		Security between groups… repos visible to all groups via github if account is found.
		$7/mo FULL private is best if doable for REPO account ONLY.

Final thought:	Learn this now to master it! Many job postings ask for Agile, SCRUM, Axosoft, and Git!!!!
