To run the program via terminal,

Enter the TuringMachine/dist folder

"cd turingMachine/TuringMachine/dist"

Then run the jar file with the following command,

"java -jar TuringMachine.jar"

For testing, try running Palindrome.tm and giving it a few different palindromes and non-palindromes. It will tell you what is a palindrome, and also what isn't. To load a different palindrome, you can click reset, and then clear and enter a new input at the prompt. Or to see the same input ran through again, click reset, and run again.

"Palindrome.tm" and "PalindromeNoComments.tm" are used for interpreter testing with more complex programs and for error/comment handling.
