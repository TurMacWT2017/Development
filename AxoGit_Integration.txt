1) SSH key and git remote setup:
	- ssh key generated on vm (AND on thor if not already done first!)
	- key transmitted to thor from vm
	- remote set-url commands to setup dual-push on commit

The remote push additions may be made after the github account is set up:
(replace X with your group number)
git remote set-url --push origin git+ssh://git@github.com/<repo-acct-name>/<repo-name>.git
git remote --add --push origin <single-sign-on-id>@thor.wtamu.edu:/exports/home/repos/CS4391-X/turingMachine	
Use: git remote –v    to list your remote urls
	Should have 1 fetch url for thor, 1 push url for thor, and 1 push url for github

	- email address (buffs) used throughout this process!

2) Github setup:
	- FREE account allows ALL to view, only COLLABORATORS to modify
	- $7/mo account allows full privatization or full open
	- setup a REPO acct (no collab) (give meaningful username, NOT repository name)
	- setup account for each group member using same email address as git configured
	- vm ssh key applied in repo account “SSH and GPG keys” for each team member
	- member github usernames applied to github repo Settings> Collaborators

4) Axosoft tagging:							
	- importance of proper time estimate and time application (actual)
	- simple set of codes to learn for commits
	- tag within brackets is included WITHIN quotations for commit message at linux cmd line

Ex:	[axof: 8 wl: 2 hours]
-	this tag will book into axosoft feature item #8 the commit message with link to github code, and will also deduct the hours tagged from the estimated hours originally input to axosoft
	Axosoft time unit tag codes:  min    hrs    days    wks    pts      (and for instance hrs can be typed "hours" as well)
